% POISSONPROC  Generates event times from a Poisson (or Poisson-like) process.%	%	Y = POISSONPROC(RATE, T), where RATE is a scalar, returns event times for a homogeneous Poisson %	process with rate RATE and a total simulation time of T.%%	Y = POISSONPROC(RATE, DT, METHOD), where RATE is a vector, returns event times for an %	inhomogeneous Poisson process with rate function RATE, sampled every DT time-units, using%	the simulation method designated by the string METHOD.  METHOD is optional with the 'approx'%   method being the default.%%	The valid method strings are:%			'approx'	 - Small time interval approximation method.  A point occurs at time t, where%							t is a multiple of dt, if U < rate(t) * dt, where U is a uniform random %							variable and rate(t) is the value of the rate function at time t.%			'transform'	 - A unit rate homogeneous Poisson process is produced, and then time is%							transformed via the rate function.  The rate function is rectified (i.e. %							negative values set to zero) before beginning the simulation in order to %							produce a Poisson process.%			'integ&fire' - The same as the 'transform' method, except the rate function is not truncated.  %                           Thus, negative "rate" values are used, and the resulting process is not really %                           a Poisson process if negative "rate" values are present.  If negative "rate" %                           values are not present, then this produces the same output as the 'transform'%                           method.  This method is equivalent to an integrate-and-fire process in%                           which the threshold changes after each firing and the thresholds are%                           independent, identically distributed exponential random variables with a%                           mean of one.%   The code for this function is contained in a MEX-file compiled from the C file 'poissonproc.c'.%   The pseudo-random numbers needed in this function are obtained from MATLAB's 'rand' function.%%   Copyright © 2005 by B.
